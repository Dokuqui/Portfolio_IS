With strong experience in Go (Golang), TypeScript, Python, and C#, I excel at building robust, scalable, and automated software solutions.<br /><br />My journey spans diverse industries â€” logistics, navigation, cybersecurity, and technology â€” where I&apos;ve honed my expertise in microservices, CI/CD pipelines, database management, and process automation.<br /><br />Driven by curiosity and a relentless desire to learn, I&apos;m particularly interested in automation and workflow optimization. I enjoy contributing to open-source projects, exploring new technologies, and pushing the boundaries of what software development and DevOps engineering can achieve.<br />",
